# WEBAT
The WEBAT (Wind Energy with Bat AI-based Tracker) is a Python-based bat tracking software, integrating machine learning and computer vision with infrared thermal sensors to enhance the monitoring and protection of bats in proximity to wind turbines. This software supports extracting 2D (pixelwise coordinates) and 3D (real-world coordinates) flight trajectories of bat, bird, and insects.
